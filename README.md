# ONE-SIDED BATTLESHIP

Learning Objective - Develop user stories from the front backwards: 
1. Select a user story
2. Create a branch for that story  
3. Add the necessary buttons/fields/forms to the view (to the HTML)
4. Write a controller method for that interface
5. Write the model method for that controller method (if necessary)
6. write the view method for that controller method (if necessary)
7. Test that story  
8. Merge that branch to master  

This assumes you have already decided on user stories and decided on a development schedule. 
We've done that for you, all you have to do is build them one at a time.  

___
### User Stories  
Users can ...   
  
0. see an empty board and a header  
1. place ships on board
2. hide ships and begin game
3. place guess on board
4. know if their guess was a hit or a miss
5. see their score after each guess
6. know when all ships are hit
7. know when a single ship is sunk

You are to develop these stories in order using the front-backwards approach.
At the end, you should have a 'perfect repo' with a live demo of your most recent version hosted on gh-pages.  Each story will be a version, don't move on to the next version until the one you're working on is stable.

## Implementation

This project is suspiciously similar to 'tictactoes'.  Consider using it as a starting point.
